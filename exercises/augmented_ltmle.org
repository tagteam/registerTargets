Our augmented version of =ltmle= uses the functions =Ltmle= and
=run_Ltmle= as user interface. The documentation is not implemented in
form of help pages. The following list covers the most important
augmentations:

* Ltmle
- Dnodes can be specified to deal with competing risks
- Argument gbounds default value is c(0,1) instead of c(0.01,1)
  
* run_Ltmle
- The argument reduce removes the memory heavy part of the objects
- Information about the call is added
