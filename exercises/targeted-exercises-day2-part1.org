#+TITLE: PhD course: Targeted Register Analysis: Exercises: Day 2 part 1

* Objectives

The learning targets of this exercise are:

- Data structure for longitudinal targeted minimum loss based
  estimation
- How to prepare the =ltmle= analysis

* Causal longitudinal data analysis: data structure

The project in the folder "register_project" contains simulated data
which are alike the data of the Danish nationwide registers. The data
are readily prepared for the analysis with the longitudinal minimum
loss based estimator (ltmle). In this exercise we examine the data
structure.

** Baseline covariates

- Load the pre-defined target =baseline_covariates=.
