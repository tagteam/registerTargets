#+TITLE: PhD course: Targeted Register Analysis: Exercises: Day 2

* Objectives

The learning targets of this exercise are:

- Using the R-package =targets= 
- Writing functions in R
- Register survival analysis: followup time, rates versus absolute risks

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* Exercise 1

The folder [[spaghetti]] contains a data set and the R-code file
[[spaghetti/rate-versus-risks.R]] which loads the data, prepares the
data and then calculates rates, rate ratios and t-year risks and
t-year risk ratios.

Translate the R-codes of the file [[spaghetti/rate-versus-risks.R]]  into a new targets project as follows:

1. Create a new empty folder for the new project.
2. Create three subfolders called =data=, =functions=, =figures=, =tables=
3. Create a new RStudio project in this new folder (see exercise 2 of day 1). Switch to this new project.
4. Create the file =_targets.R= in this new folder
5. Create the file called =run_targets.R= in this new folder
6. Copy the data that are read by [[spaghetti/rate-versus-risks.R]] to the new subfolder =data=
7. Copy all functions from the file  [[spaghetti/rate-versus-risks.R]] to the new subfolder =functions=
8. Create the targets pipeline in the file =_targets.R= by:
   + writing =library(targets)=
   + sourcing all functions from the subfolder =functions= (see 
   copying/translating all the remaining R-codes into targets.  Don't
   do add all of the targets at once. Add them one-by-one and check in
   between if =tar_make()= runs without errors.
9. Copy all the leftovers (such as =str(pop)= and =table(pop$event)=)
   into the file =run_targets.R=. The file =run_targets.R= should
   run the following lines without errors:
#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
library(targets)
tar_make()
tar_load(tableRR)
fwrite(tableRR,file="tables/tableRR.csv")
tar_load(km)
pdf("figures/Kaplan-Meier-plot.pdf")
plot(km)
dev.off()
#+END_SRC
