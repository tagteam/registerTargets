#+TITLE: PhD course: Targeted Register Analysis: Exercises: Day 4

* Objectives

The learning targets of this exercise are:

- Review a working analysis using longitudinal targeted minimum loss estimation (=ltmle=)
- Modify the analysis according to variations of the target parameters

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* Exercise 1

- Switch to the RStudio project /statins/ (e.g., via recent projects)
- Open the file =_targets.R= (e.g., via "Control-Shift f" eller "Control .") 
- Read the file =_targets.R=
- Open and work through the file =run_targets.R= then continue here
- Reports the results from the analysis in one or several conclusion sentence(s) which explain the target parameters and contain the =ltmle= estimates with 95% confidence intervals.
  
* Exercise 2

- Change the analysis to use =glm= instead of =glmnet=
- Subset the analysis
