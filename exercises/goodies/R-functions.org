** Writing functions in R

In R language a function looks like this:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes :eval never
# f is the name of the function
f <- function(arg1, # arg1 is the name of the first argument
              b,    # b is the name of the second argument
              use_this = TRUE, # use_this is the name of the third argument
                               # the default value is TRUE
              ...   # additional arguments that are passed on to other functions
              ){
  # [FUNCTION DEFINITION HERE]
}
#+END_SRC

Here is an example:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output :exports both  :session *R* :cache yes  
get_pop <- function(data,age_var="age",age_limit){
  sub <- data[data[[age_var]] <= age_limit]
  sub
}
data <- data.table(pnr=c(19,9,27,45,3),sex=c(1,0,0,1,0),age=c(70,86,54,66,71))
sub70 <- get_pop(data=data,age_limit=70)
sub70
#+END_SRC

:    pnr sex age
: 1:  19   1  70
: 2:  27   0  54
: 3:  45   1  66

The best way to learning writing functions is /learning by doing/.
