*** Turn off .RData

The .RData files if they exist contain the R-objects that you had
loaded when you exited your previous R session. It is generally better
to keep the R-code that produces these objects. Also, the R-package
=targets= that we are going to work with provides a much more
sophisticated way to save objects. A third reason is that large
register data when unpurposely saved in .RData or loaded from .RData
slow down everything. Hence, to turn the .RData dialog off goto:

=Tools -> Global options=

and

1. uncheck the save .RData into workspace at startup
2. set the save workspace to .RData on exit to =Never=

** Rstudio projects

For the exercises, we work with RStudio projects, see section 8.4 in
this document: https://r4ds.had.co.nz/workflow-projects.html. You
should now read about projects and then create the specific RStudio
projects for the exercises as explained in Exercise 2.

** RStudio search functions

Sometimes it is interesting to copy a specific piece of code from a
different project. However, it can be difficult to know where someone
(including yourself) has saved these lines of code. Note that RStudio
has quite remarkable search/find functions, including
- =Control-Shift-f=
- =Control-.=
- =F2= when cursor is on a function name
