Our augmented version of =ltmle= implements the functions =Ltmle= and
=run_Ltmle= as (improved) user interface. The augmentation makes it
user friendly in presence of competing risks. Unfortunately,
documentation of the augmentations is not yet available in form of
help pages. But following list covers the most important changes
compared to ltmle::ltmle:

* Ltmle

- Dnodes can be specified to deal with competing risks
- Argument gbounds default value is c(0,1) instead of c(0.01,1)
- Can run multiple time_horizons in one call
  
* run_Ltmle

- Data are submitted in chunks. This makes it relatively easy to run the analysis
  with different outcomes and treatments. The chunks are:
  - baseline covariates
  - timevarying covariates
  - treatment variables
  - outcome (including censoring and competing risks)
- The argument reduce removes the memory heavy part of the objects
- Information about the call is added
