* The R-package targets

The R package =targets= has many features and the following potentials for register data research projects:

- pipeline: from reading of raw data to tables and figures, it is made explicitly clear in which order the steps of the analysis are executed and how they depend on each other
- reproducibility: all results are reproducible including the random ones, e.g., bootstrap or simulation
- efficiency: it is easy to load previously run data or results  

The main source of information is the online manual:

** The _targets.R file

A targets project is defined by an R-script called =_targets.R=. The
=_targets.R= file contains the pipeline.

** Before the pipeline

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes
library(targets)
for (f in list.files("functions/",
                     pattern = "R$",
                     recursive = TRUE,
                     full.names = TRUE)){source(f)}
tar_option_set(packages=c("data.table","heaven","prodlim","survival","riskRegression","ranger","ggplot2","glmnet","matrixStats","lava","Publish"))
#+END_SRC

** The targets

A target is an R-object which consists of a name, a value, and other
parameters such as =packages= which loads additional packages only for
this target:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
tar_target(name,{
  # the body of the target
  # can consist multiple lines
  # the value is what the last line returns
  # can also be the call to a function
  value 
},packages="dplyr")
#+END_SRC

** The pipeline

The pipeline is a list of targets:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
list(
  tar_target(target1,{
    depends on no other targets
  }),
  tar_target(target2,{
    may depend on target1
  }),
  tar_target(target3,{
    may depend on target1 or on target2 or on both
  })
)
#+END_SRC

** Commands

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
#
# show the pipeline
#
tar_manifest()
tar_visnetwork(targets_only=TRUE)
tar_outdated()
#
# evaluate the pipeline
#
# run all targets of the pipeline (which need to be run)
tar_make()
# run target2 (if it needs to be run) and all targets on which target2 depends
tar_make(target2)
# run target2 directly without checking other targets
tar_make(target2,shortcut=TRUE)
#
# load/read objects
#
tar_load(target2)
t2 <- tar_read(target2)
tar_load(everything)
#
# delete targets
#
tar_delete(target2)
# delete all targets
tar_destroy()
# delete targets that are not in the current pipeline, i.e., obsolete
tar_prune()
#+END_SRC

** Behind the scene

When the pipeline is executed via =tar_make()= the targets are saved
in the subfolder =_targets/objects= of the current project directory.
The files =_targets/meta/progress=, =_targets/meta/process= and
=_targets/meta/meta= provide information about the targets. The latter
can be read into R as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
tar_meta()
tar_meta(fields=c("type","seed","time","size","warnings"))
#+END_SRC

** Controlling dependencies
#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
tar_target(name,{body},cue = tar_cue(mode = "never"))
tar_target(name,{body},cue = tar_cue(mode = "always"))
#+END_SRC
