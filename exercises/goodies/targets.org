* The R-package targets

** Before the pipeline

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes
library(targets)
for (f in list.files("functions/",
                     pattern = "R$",
                     recursive = TRUE,
                     full.names = TRUE)){source(f)}
tar_option_set(packages=c("data.table","heaven","prodlim","survival","riskRegression","ranger","ggplot2","glmnet","matrixStats","lava","Publish"))
#+END_SRC

** The targets

A target is an R-object which consists of a name, a value, and other
parameters such as =packages= which loads additional packages only for
this target:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
tar_target(name,{
  # the body of the target
  # can consist multiple lines
  # the value is what the last line returns
  # can also be the call to a function
  value 
},packages="dplyr")
#+END_SRC

** The pipeline

The pipeline is a list of targets:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
list(
  tar_target(target1,{
    depends on no other targets
  }),
  tar_target(target2,{
    may depend on target1
  }),
  tar_target(target3,{
    may depend on target1 or on target2 or on both
  })
)
#+END_SRC

** Commands

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
#
# show the pipeline
#
tar_manifest()
tar_visnetwork(targets_only=TRUE)
tar_outdated()
#
# evaluate the pipeline
#
# run all targets of the pipeline (which need to be run)
tar_make()
# run target2 (if it needs to be run) and all targets on which target2 depends
tar_make(target2)
# run target2 directly without checking other targets
tar_make(target2,shortcut=TRUE)
#
# load/read objects
#
tar_load(target2)
t2 <- tar_read(target2)
tar_load(everything)
#
# delete targets
#
tar_delete(target2)
# delete all targets
tar_destroy()
# delete targets that are not in the current pipeline, i.e., obsolete
tar_prune()
#+END_SRC

** Behind the scene

When the pipeline is executed via =tar_make()= the targets are saved
in the subfolder =_targets/objects= of the current project directory.
The files =_targets/meta/progress=, =_targets/meta/process= and
=_targets/meta/meta= provide information about the targets. The latter
can be read into R as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  :eval never
tar_meta()
tar_meta(fields=c("type","seed","time","size","warnings"))
#+END_SRC
