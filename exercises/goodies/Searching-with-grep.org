** The R-functions =grep= and =grepl= 

Suppose we want to extract drugs from a vector of ATC codes.

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output   :exports both  :session *R* :cache yes  
heaven::atccodes
#+END_SRC

#+begin_example
          ATC
   1: A01AA01
   2: A01AB02
   3: A01AB03
   4: A01AB04
   5: A01AB09
  ---        
1370: R06AX27
1371: R06AX28
1372: R06AX29
1373: R07AB01
1374: R07AB07
#+end_example

The functions =grep= and =grepl= search for matches of a /single/ (not a vector!)
search-expression in a vector. For example, we can search for "A10"

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output :exports both  :session *R* :cache yes  
grep("A01",heaven::atccodes$ATC)
grep("A01",heaven::atccodes$ATC,value=TRUE)
grepl("A01",heaven::atccodes$ATC)
#+END_SRC

Note that the object =heaven::atccodes= is a =data.table= and hence we
can subset to all matching rows as follows:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output :exports both  :session *R* :cache yes  
heaven::atccodes[grepl("A01",ATC)]
#+END_SRC

#+begin_example
         ATC
  1: A01AA01
  2: A01AB02
  3: A01AB03
  4: A01AB04
  5: A01AB09
 ---        
 99: N07BA01
100: N07CA01
101: R03AA01
102: R03BA01
103: R05DA01
#+end_example

Now, we only want ATC codes which start with "A01". Hence, we specify
a so-called /regular expression/ where the =^= indicates that the term
=^A01= should occur at the beginning of the ATC code:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output :exports both  :session *R* :cache yes  
heaven::atccodes[grepl("^A01",heaven::atccodes$ATC)]
#+END_SRC

#+begin_example
        ATC
 1: A01AA01
 2: A01AB02
 3: A01AB03
 4: A01AB04
 5: A01AB09
 6: A01AB13
 7: A01AB17
 8: A01AB22
 9: A01AC01
10: A01AD01
11: A01AD02
12: A01AD11
#+end_example
