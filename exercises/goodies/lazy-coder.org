** Leaving humanreadible traces

When inspecting other peoples code it is quite useful to know who
started the project and when. Unfortunately, no one has time to do
this. Luckily RStudio allows you to define automatic headers:

** Lazy coder

R-syntax is difficult to remember. 
- RStudio has snippets, see =Tools -> Edit Code Snippets=

Whenever you catch yourself looking up the same cryptic code for the
third time it is worth considering a new snippet. For example, here is
a snippet which inserts code to select the first row per person from a
data.table:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
snippet first
	${1:name}[${1}[,.I[1],by="pnr"]$V1]
#+END_SRC

Here is a reference:

- dput inserts code in R-code syntax, such as names of dataset or levels of a factor:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
library(survival)
dput(names(pbc))
dput(unique(pbc$edema))
#+END_SRC  
  
- Publish::lazyFactorCoding

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
d <- data.table(a=rep(1:3,4),
                b=letters[1:2],
                adate=paste0("15-",8:11,"-2020"),
                bdate=paste0(8:11,"-15","-2020"))
lazyFactorCoding(d)
lazyDateCoding(d,pattern="date")
#+END_SRC
