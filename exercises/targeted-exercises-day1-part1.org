* Objectives

The learning targets of this exercise are:

- Download the course material.
- Create the RStudio project.

** Reading references 

An important part of the exercises consists of reading. The reading
material includes both general information and also instructions on
how to prepare the remaining exercises. To prepare the course you
should readily have performed the version check:

-  [[goodies/R-packages.org]]
-  [[goodies/RStudio-projects.org]]

----------------------------------------------------------------------

* RStudio projects for course exercises

** Download all files from github

*** Via zip file

https://github.com/tagteam/registerTargets/archive/refs/heads/main.zip

Unzip the file in a good neighborhood on your computer. 

*** Using git

If you have the program =git= installed you can clone the github
repository (in a good neighborhood on your computer):

#+BEGIN_SRC sh
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/tagteam/registerTargets/
#+END_SRC

* Create RStudio projects

You should now have a folder called /registerTargets/ in you computer.
Use the RStudio dialog /New project/ where you choose /Existing
Directory/ to create a project for the subfolder:

=exercises/example_project=

Then, also create a second RStudio project for the subfolder:

=exercises/register_project=

You can now switch back and forth between the two projects using the main menu of RStudio.
