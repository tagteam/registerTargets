#+TITLE: PhD course: Targeted Register Analysis: Exercises: Day 4 part 3

* Objectives

The learning target of this exercise is to clean up the targets
projects and to check reproducibility.

* Clean-up


- Clean-up and check if all targets of all previous exercises from
  course days 2-4 are in the file =_target.R=.

- Go through the file =register_project/sandbox.R= and check if you
  miss anything valuable.

- Consider the size and run-time of the targets:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
show_performance()
#+END_SRC  
  
- Destroy all targets:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
tar_destroy()
#+END_SRC


- Re-run all targets:

#+BEGIN_SRC R  :results output raw  :exports code  :session *R* :cache yes  
tar_make()
#+END_SRC
  
- Debug until everything works and the results have been reproduces.
